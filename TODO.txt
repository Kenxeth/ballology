ADD JWT
* watch the yt video so it can check if the jwt token exists through tabs 
* to authenticate users to protected resources

* figure out if a user is logged in and they try to go to the log in page to reroute them back to
* the main chat page 
(probably same thing were going to do up there)

CREATE log out page
* delete cookie
* take user back to log in page

CHECK IF U CAN ADD AN ERROR MESSAGE FROM EXPRESS when an exception is thrown
(probably make_response since were sending a response from server to client)
